# Social Engineering

A system is only as strong as the weakest member, and that is often a human being.

## \#1. Being helpful

Humans usually are happy to helps another person.
In this scenario, Eve runs into the reception of a big corporate office with her papers soaked in coffee.. So the receptionist, wants to help Eve with her documents which she needs for her job interview.
In advance, Eve has prepared a malicious USB stick with documents designed to compromise computers it plugged into.
She hands the receptionist the evil USB stick and with a big smile and a huge "please" ask the receptionist if it can print the documents.

## \#2. Using fear.

People often fear of failing or not do as order.
With fear, attackers can try to coerce victims into doing what their need.
For example they can pretend to be the company director asking for information, perhaps a social media update revelated the director is away on vacation and this can be used to stage the attack.

The victim probably does not want to challenge the director, and because the director is on vacation, it might be harder to verify the information.

## \#3. Reciprocation.


Reciprocation is doing something in return, like a response to someone who mades you a favour.

For example, someone holding you the door in the front-door of your office building, because of this you're likely to want to hold the next door.
This last door might be behind access-control, needing employees to present their badges, but to offer the same kindness in return, you keep the door is held open.
This called **tailgating**.


## \#4. Curiosity.

Humans are curious by nature, what would you do if you found a USB stick lying on the ground outside of your office? Plug it in? What if the USB stick contained a document entitled "salary information - current updates"? Would you open it?

An attacker could deliberately drop many malicious USB sticks around the area where emplyees reside, hoping someone will plug them in.
The files inside can be viruses masked (trojan) as a normal and legit document.  


## \#. 5. Panic

Attackers create a panic scenario, pushing the victim into a state of confusion and pressure.
For example, attackers by a phone call warns there is a dangerous virus which infect all pc that revieve a specific email (previously sent by the attackers), then, attackers push the victim into install an "antivirus" (which is a trojan).


## \#. Phishing

Phishing is a quite known technique, where attackers will try to coerce victim into giving away sensitive details such as their credentials or have them install malicious applications.
